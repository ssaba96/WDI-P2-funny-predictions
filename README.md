![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png)

### Overview

A full-stack authentication application that lists out zodiac signs for users and on selecting their sign, they are given a prediction for the day.


### Project Brief

Your app must:
- Have at least 2 models one representing a user and one that represents the main resource of your app, e.g. Restaurants
- Include relationships - embedded or referenced. Make sure you take the time to consider the best approach before building out your models.
- The app should include authentication - with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow.
- Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of your resources with all CRUD actions.
- You must use SCSS - as this is a key industry skill.
- Include wireframes - that you designed before building the app.
- Have semantically clean HTML - you make sure you write HTML that makes structural sense rather than thinking about how it might look, which is the job of CSS.
- Be deployed online and accessible to the public.

### Challenges and Problems

- It was challenging to generate random computer choice of the prediction.

- It was difficult to display the same prediction throughout the day, everytime user logged in again.

---

### Wins

- The user is notified with predictions everyday.

---

### Future Features

Features I would have liked to include:

- I would like to add styling and animations.
- I would like to add a form feature where user is given prediction according to choices they select.
